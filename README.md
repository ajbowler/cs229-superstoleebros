cs229-superstoleebros
=====================
Pacman clone written in C++ for a class project.

The `.o` files and some of the `.hpp` files were not from my source files, they were provided by Professor Derrick Stolee for the class.

#### Running the program
Clone the repo and run `make`. Then run `./ssbros` plus whatever flags you want. Details on permitted flags can be found here: [Professor Stolee's website](http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dstolee/teaching/14-229/project2/)
